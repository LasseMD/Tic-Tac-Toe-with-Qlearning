# Tic-Tac-Toe with Q learning

## Reinforcement Learning Approach
The project utilizes Q-learning, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. Q-learning is well-suited for finding the optimal action-selection policy in a finite Markov decision process. In this case, it is employed to train the Tic-Tac-Toe policy, allowing the agent to learn from its interactions with the game environment and improve its strategy over time.

## Description

The Tic-Tac-Toe final project aims to implement and train a policy to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally using reinforcement learning. The project consists of two main parts:

### Part 1: Create Computational Framework
- Develop a computational framework to play, test, and evaluate Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Functions to facilitate gameplay between two humans, a human and a random strategy, and a human and a policy.
- Necessary functionalities include creating a functional board, making moves, and evaluating the board.

### Part 2: Train Optimal Policy
- Train a policy to play Tic-Tac-Toe as perfectly as possible using reinforcement learning.
- Play Tic-Tac-Toe policies against each other to gather experience and improve performance over time.
- Test the improving policy against a random player and a perfect strategy during training.
- Plot the performance over training time to illustrate the progression of the training method.
